        <h1>White Space and Clean Design</h1>
        <h2>Google</h2>
        <a href="https://www.google.com" target="_blank">google.com</a>
        <img src="images/google.png" alt="google homepage">
        <p>Google does an exemplary job of utilizing white space, first off, they are simply playing into what they, are a search engine. Having any amount of distracting items other than the google logo itself would detract from what the site is supposed to be. Google also has its apps and other utility options in the corners of the page out of the way of the search bar as to not distract from it.</p>

    <section id="section2">
        <h1>PARC: Proximity</h1>
        <h2>W3Schools</h2>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">w3schools.com</a>
        <img src="images/w3schools.png" alt="w3schools homepage">
        <p>Once you scroll past the initial search bar, W3Schools has a list of languages all neatly stacked one atop another. However, their borders are well marked and the content within them takes up an appropraite amount of space and each one has a corresponding snippet of code next to it. Each section is clearly defined and the content inside those sections is far enough from the border that it isn't crammed and it is presented neatly. Going further down, we see language and tool names all stacked, while I would say this looks a little tight next to eachother, the tabs are presented such that they are next to or above other languages or tools that are sibling languages or something that benefits one of those nearby languages.</p>

    <section id="section3">
        <h1>Hick's Law</h1>
        <h2>FPP</h2>
        <a href="https://fpp.net" target="_blank">fpp.net</a>
        <img id="img3" src="images/fpp.jpg" alt="FPP homepage">
        <p id="para3">I believe that FPP follows an interesting take on Hick's Law. Right when you load up the website, there aren't choices everywhere, no pages selection, no search bar. Instead, the site loads up an interactive intro to the site, this helps to draw you in as you go through this intro so that when you are finished with it, it has grabbed your attention as well as given you information about the site. By eliminating any distractions or other choices right when the site loads, they already have a hook on you by giving you some attraction right off the bat, something that most sites don't have.</p>
